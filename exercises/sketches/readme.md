# Electro Sounds - The Voxel Reactor

A Project by Fairuz Ramlan using P5.js for Electro-Sounds Semester 2.


## Project Description

The Voxel Reactor is the culmination of 14-weeks of Creative Coding Learning by Fairuz Ramlan. It is an Audio-Reactive Music Visualizer that combines both aesthetic and function; Coming to Life when fed with pumping bass music or even a simple "Hello" into a Microphone would do the job. Armed with a Voxelized Polygon (A Polygon made up entirely of Cubes or Voxels); It grows in Size and form with the right frequency and volume. There are in total 9 different Audio-Reactive Backgrounds that a user can select using the number keys 1-9 with the key 0 to be back to black. These Background Visuals warp, distort or change colour when fed with Audio and Music. It incorporates Audio-Reactivity and Interactivity; Well-suited for Live Performance and Real-time Visuals with interesting and colourful aesthetics that runs in your Browser.

## Reflection

The journey of creative coding is one that was never promised to be easy. Being still new to the concept of coding and programming for creative purposes, it was at first a challenge to discover patterns within the same digital art that we see all this time and to produce a similar outcome using Functions and Loops. It slowly got easier with more practice done and a lot of emulation done of digital art that others have made or adapted. One good example of an exercise that was beneficial to the improvement of my competency in P5.js were the Recode exercises – Where we would take existing digital art that others have created or adapted and attempt to replicate them; With some minor differences and additional things we can add. Although P5.js is only but a portion at what Javascript can do if compared to the capabilities of Processing; It was enough to create simple to moderately complex Digital Art and Applications that run in the convenience of your Browser. I am thankful for the process up till the end as it has taught me how to be patient when running into errors made by silly typos or wrong implementations and to always do one thing – "If first you don't succeed, try, try again with a new line of code."
It has also empowered me with the basic knowledge to create Browser Based Applications or Visuals in which I can incorporate into my Live Music Performances and Portfolio; Further expanding it from only heavily audio-based materials but also have visual-based ones as well.

### Code

All code can be found within the Github Folders and are labelled accordingly to whether they are "Exercises" or the Final Project for the Website.

### Getting Started

- While The Voxel Reactor is running, press Number Keys 1-9 to cycle through the different Visuals that act as the background. Number Key 0 can be used to return back to the default state.

- Do not forget to turn on MIC to see Audio-Reactivity.

-Works best with fast-paced music with a lot of bass and dynamics.


### What's in here?

- My exercises done the past 14 weeks under the archive folder
- My final outcome in the final folder.
